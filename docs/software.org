Once you have obtained a functional computational platform, the
flavour of linux you'd like to drink from is up to you.

For beginners, I'd recommend a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian][debian]]-based distro for security
reasons.
* Distro
** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian][Debian]]
*** [[https://linuxmint.com/][Linux Mint]]
**** [[https://linuxmint.com/download.php][download]]
 Select the bit and desktop version you'd like to run.

 As a physicist, I'd recommend the lightweight [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce][Xfce]] to save on
 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity][electricity]]. Older computers may only have a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit][CPU]] that supports 32-bit,
 and can still function beautifully as a mind mirror. People routinely
 underestimate the power of a pen.
* Install
** bootable usb
*** dd
For those of you with linux already.

#+begin_src sh
#find usb
lsblk

# write linux.iso to usb
dd bs=4M if=path/to/linux.iso of=/dev/sdx status=progress oflag=sync
#+end_src
*** [[https://rufus.ie/][Rufus]]
Used a few times on osx and doze. Works rather well.
